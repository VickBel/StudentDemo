## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Including references

You can easily handle your references in Rstudio. Citations can be found using direct search in Rstudio, or from Zotero. These are added to a .bib file that is included in your project. Example of a reference: [@Stelfox2012a][@Lancet2020]

## Using styles

Adding a csl file to your header will modify the formatting output of your document.

## Useful packages

There's a lot of packages that can be used in R, helping you with everything from datahandling, statistics and modeling to formatting output. Some of the most commonly used include [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) and [bookdown](https://bookdown.org).

## Commenting

Readers can easily comment on your text by including them in this format: <!-- Here's a comment -->. They will not be visible in the knitted version of the document.
